# Arduino ESP32 MAVLink

Arduino ESP32 MAVLink is a communications API designed for the Arduino or ESP32 (tested on ESP32) using the mavlink-c-library-v2. This library focuses on AUTO/MISSION mode built in with the PX4 Firmware. With this library, you can fly a drone with PX4 Firmware without a QGroundControl because this API acts as the QGC itself. Source code is in mavlink_commands.cpp and mavlink_commands.hpp.

## UDP-SITL branch 

UDP-SITL is a branch designed to test the API using Gazebo11 (Gazebo Classic) simulator provided by PX4. Head to the UDP-SITL branch for more info.
